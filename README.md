# NLP (Natural Language Processing) Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in analyzing text data and building a text classification model using Python and popular data science libraries. In this project, we use a dataset of Yelp reviews to perform sentiment analysis and classify reviews into two categories: positive (5 stars) and negative (1 star). The project covers various stages of text data analysis, including data exploration, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `NLP_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the NLP analysis.
- `yelp.csv`: CSV file containing Yelp reviews and associated information.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`NLP_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `yelp.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the NLP analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Data Exploration

The project starts with data exploration:

- Loading the Yelp review dataset and exploring its structure.
- Visualizing data patterns, such as the distribution of text lengths and ratings.

## Text Classification

The main part of the project involves text classification:

- Preprocessing the text data by converting reviews into numerical features using Count Vectorization.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
- Training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and making predictions.
- Evaluating the model's performance using a confusion matrix and a classification report.

## Text Classification with TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

The project also explores text classification with TF-IDF:

- Building a text classification pipeline that includes Count Vectorization, TF-IDF transformation, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training the pipeline and evaluating the model's performance.
